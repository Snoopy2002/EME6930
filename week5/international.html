<!--Page should be for some sort of school and contain a form for parents to put their child on a waiting list.
The form will have entry boxes for the student name, age , gender, and their upcoming grade.
It should also have a drop down selector for which school the child will be on a waiting list.
There should be buttons for 4-6 different schools and each button should call a function that displays the information about the school within a container division on the page as in the week 4 project.
The page should be designed to be responsive.-->
